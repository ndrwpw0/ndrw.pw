Hello there. I'm ndrw. I guess I should state the intent of this website at this juncture, right? Right.

This website will be mostly about my pursuit of getting into the InfoSec field, crossing over from my current career as a Systems Engineer. This will also be my online <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microblogging">microblog</a> (too bad that term never caught on) but without being on Tumblr's platform. Owning my own online space is important to me. 

Moving on...

Expect some gifs, some YouTube videos I like, maybe some small, fictional stories, and some light commentary on my political views. 

✌️
